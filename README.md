# Length-of-Last-Word

Given a string s consists of some words separated by spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. If the last word does not exist, return 0.

A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

`
Input: s = "Hello World"

Output: 5
`


_Example 2:_

`
Input: s = " "

Output: 0
`
 

_Constraints:_

`
1 <= s.length <= 10^4
`

s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
